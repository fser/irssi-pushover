## irssi pushover

This script sends you notification(s) using [pushover](https://pushover.net).
It implements a delay (default 30sec) and requires you to be
away to send the actual notification.

I recommand using [autoaway.pl](https://github.com/irssi/scripts.irssi.org/blob/gh-pages/scripts/autoaway.pl) for that purpose.

## Todo

 * Use irssi settings for user key
 * Use irssi settings for the notification delay
